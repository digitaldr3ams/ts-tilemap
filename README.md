# Tilemap Example
A small example of a very basic 2D tilemap generator written in TypeScript in a very small amount of time. There's *almost* no logic determining how things are placed in relation to other structures.

## Usage
- Install packages: `npm i`
- Compile and run: `npm run clean_start`
- Run without compiling: `npm run generate`

Transpiled output will be placed in the `js` folder.
